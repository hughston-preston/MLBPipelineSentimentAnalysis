            "text/plain": "[\" While Carlos Correa was a deserving choice for No. 1 overall pick in many respects, it was Buxton most considered the top overall talent in the 2012 Draft class and the Twins were more than thrilled to add his potential to the system. Buxton has a full toolbox, with the ability to do everything well on the baseball field. His speed is his best present tool and that will help him be a threat on the bases and play a very good center field. He has plenty of bat speed and while his power isn't going to show up just yet, most feel he'll grow into it as he develops. More than anything, he just needs to go out and play, so he can learn how to use his tremendous tools consistently on the field. The Twins tend to be conservative in their development plans, so they will show the necessary patience in cultivating Buxton's considerable talents.\",\n \" The St. Louis Cardinals have developed some All-Star-caliber position players in recent years, starting of course with Albert Pujols and including Yadier Molina. Taveras has every chance to be next in line, the kind of talent that doesn't come around all too often. Always young for his level, he has hit everywhere he's gone, and in 2012, the power most felt he had started to show up consistently in games. Taveras has a ton of bat speed and rarely strikes out. His improvement in terms of plate discipline has made him an even more dangerous hitter, one who looks like a sure-fire middle-of-the-order run producer. With that offensive profile and his strong arm, Taveras looks like a future right fielder, but he played a lot of center field in 2012 and could see time there as well, at least in the short run. Regardless of where he plays, the Cardinals will have a hard time keeping his bat out of the lineup for too long.\",\n \" Sano has been in the spotlight since signing out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. While his pro career is still relatively in its nascent stages, one thing is clear: reports of Sano's power have not been exaggerated. It's easily plus and it shows up in games now, with more coming. He can hit the ball out of any park to all fields, and while he swings and misses a good amount, he improved his plate discipline and is drawing more walks. His defense is a bigger question mark. Sano is a big young man, but he is fairly agile and does have the tools -- particularly a plus arm -- to stay there. He will need, however, to improve his footwork and focus in order to do so. Sano turns just 20 in 2013, so there's no reason to rush him, with the payoff being a very special run producer at the hot corner.\",\n \" The Mariners didn't have a first-round pick in the 2010 Draft, but that's not something that bothers them all that much thanks to the development of Walker, their first selection that June. The 2012 Futures Gamer was the youngest pitcher in the Southern League and was dominant in the first half, though he did falter in the second half. He has the makings of an excellent three-pitch mix, with a plus fastball, complemented by a curve and changeup, both of which have the chance to be at least above-average. He still needs to tighten up his command, but his athleticism - he was a basketball standout in high school - should allow him to do improve on that and become the frontline starter people project him as.<p>\",\n \" Any baseball field Lindor is on, he looks like he belongs, whether it was as the youngest regular in the Midwest League in 2012 or in a big league stadium at the All-Star Futures Game. An argument can be made that Lindor is the best defensive shortstop in the Minors. Not only does he have an outstanding arm and well above-average range, but those tools play up because of his off-the-charts instincts and feel for the position. But he's far from all glove. He has a quick swing and advanced approach that leads to hard line drives to all fields. He has some power, particularly to the pull side, but can also play small ball. An above-average runner, those instincts allow him to be a basestealing threat. His tools combined with his plus plus makeup have most believing he'll make an impact in Cleveland in a hurry.\",\n \" The Aruba native and 2012 Futures Game participant has some serious tools and he's used them to rush up the Red Sox's organizational ladder, reaching Double-A in 2012 at age 19. He has the ability to make hard contact and can shoot the ball to all fields with excellent bat speed and a smooth swing. He has significant raw power he's still learning to tap into and he will be a better overall hitter as his plate discipline continues to improve, something that happened in the Carolina League in 2012, but not as much once he moved up a level. His plus arm works just fine from shortstop and while he's an average runner, he has better range than one would expect for a player his size. If he has to move over to third, his bat looks like it will play just fine there, though Will Middlebrooks is standing in the way there.\",\n \" By all accounts, Bradley's first full season in pro ball was a success, as the second Oklahoma high schooler taken in the top 10 of the 2011 Draft was a Midwest League All-Star and finished second in the Minors with a .181 batting average against. He finished second in the league in strikeouts and while he also topped the circuit in walks, he projects to have at least average command. His fastball, which tops out at 95 mph, has some serious sink to generate groundball outs. His curve has sharp bite to it, though he doesn't always command it well. He has a feel for a changeup with some fade to it, giving him the chance to have three average or better offerings at his disposal. Very athletic - he was a standout QB in high school - that should allow him to maximize his tools on the mound.\",\n \" Don't think the selection of Correa as the top overall pick in the 2012 Draft was simply a money-saver for the Astros. Sure, it allowed them to be more creative with later selections, but Correa was one of the most talented players in the Draft class. He can flat out play shortstop, with at least above-average tools defensively, from his range and actions to his plus arm. While his glove is ahead of his overall offensive skillset right now, he's far from being a defense-only guy. He's an above-average runner now, though he might slow down a tick over time. He has the chance to have above-average power at a premium position. The biggest question is over how much he'll hit. Even if he's just an average hitter, with his other tools, that makes him an elite shortstop in the future, and with off-the-charts makeup and work ethic, it might be a mistake to underestimate what his ceiling is.\",\n \" When two high school shortstops are taken one spot after another, it's bound to create comparison and competition. Perhaps people will take sides in the Javier Baez vs. Francisco Lindor debate for years, but there's no question both are extremely talented young middle infielders. Baez didn't head to full-season ball right away, but when he did, he quickly hit his way up a level, then showed off some pop in the Arizona Fall League before getting hurt. Baez has plus bat speed that should allow him to hit for a ton of power and average, especially if he can refine his approach and gain better plate discipline. Many were ready to move Baez to third right away, but he showed some ability at shortstop, with a very good arm and good hands. His instincts allow his average speed to play up on both sides of the ball. Even if he has to move to third, his bat should profile just fine there.\",\n \" Pirates fans who are eagerly anticipating the arrival of the one-two punch of Gerrit Cole and Jameson Taillon shouldn't have to wait too much longer. The big right-hander who came from the Texas high school ranks finished the season in Double-A, with three outstanding starts to finish the year. His fastball is a plus pitch and he'll touch 96-97 mph with it. Taillon's secondary stuff is still developing, but both his breaking ball and offspeed offering have the chance to be above-average pitches. He gained more confidence in his curve as the year went on and he showed better feel for his changeup as well. Taillon is still growing into his body and tweaking his delivery, leading to some overall command issues, though that shouldn't be a long-term concern. Another year of experience under his belt might be all he needs to be ready for Pittsburgh.\",\n \" Ever since the Tigers took him and gave him a way above-slot bonus in 2010, Castellanos has hit his way quickly up the organizational ladder, reaching Double-A in 2012 and winning Futures Game MVP honors along the way. He can flat-out hit, adjusting extremely well to any and all pitching. He drives the ball to all fields and while he hasn't shown too much in the way of home run power to date, there is definitely pop in his bat that will come. Castellanos started his pro career as a third baseman and could have been an average defender there, but he moved to the outfield in 2012, largely to find the quickest path to the big leagues for his bat. There isn't a spot waiting for him just yet, but don't be surprised if he hits his way into Detroit's plans in the near future.\",\n \"Syndergaard has dominated professional hitters since the Blue Jays took him 38th overall in 2010. He was a key piece of the deal that sent R.A. Dickey to Toronto in December 2012, and he started the Futures Game for the U.S. team the next summer. Snydergaard uses his height well, throwing downhill with some movement. Though his fastball is plus, thrown up to 96 mph consistently, he's more than just a thrower. His power curve has improved as he's added velocity to it, and it could be an above-average breaking ball in the future. He has a power changeup as well, which is still a work in progress but could give him a third above-average offering. Despite his size, he has an easy delivery and he throws strikes. His combination of stuff, pitchability and aggressiveness on the mound point to a future as a frontline starter.\",\n '\\n \\nThere were few prospects in all of the Minor Leagues who broke out more than Polanco did in 2012. The speedy center fielder topped the system in stolen bases and finished second in a host of other offensive categories. He has the chance to be a true five-tooler on the field. With a long, lean frame, he&#8217;s an aggressive swinger who started to learn the values of plate discipline, making him a much more dangerous hitter. He should hit for average and at least a little power. His plus speed will make him a long-term basestealing threat and an outstanding defensive outfielder.',\n '\\n \\nWhat a difference two years can make. Coming out of high school, Gausman was a highly thought of pitcher with a ton of arm strength, but little else. After two seasons at LSU, he emerged as the top college arm taken in the 2012 Draft. He still has the power, his fastball is an easy plus pitch, but he&#8217;s learned a lot more about his overall craft. He backs up his heater with another plus pitch, a changeup, which fades and sinks. His breaking stuff has always lagged behind a bit as he toyed with both a curve and slider in college, with the latter likely being the better option going forward. Improving that, along with his overall command, are all he needs to be a frontline starter in the big leagues in the near future.',\n \" It's not often that a pitcher makes it to the big leagues in his first full season as a professional. It's even less common when one taken out of high school does it, but that's exactly what Bundy accomplished in 2012. The Oklahoma prep product started the year in the South Atlantic League and finished it in Baltimore. Along the way, he showed an ability to throw several pitches for strikes. His fastball is easily plus, thrown up to 98 mph, and he maintains velocity deep into his starts with a clean and easy delivery. His curve should be at least above-average in the future, though he's still learning to throw it consistently. He has good arm speed on his changeup, which should be another above-average or better pitch. He looks every bit the top of the rotation starter the Orioles hoped they were getting when they gave him a Major League contract.<p>\",\n \"It's not often that a player with Hamilton's electricity and game-changing ability comes along. He is the fastest man in baseball, and that, along with an aggressiveness on the basepaths, led to him setting a record for stolen bases in a season in 2012 (155). The switch-hitter will get on base any way he can, improving his plate discipline to draw more walks, bunting and, of course, beating out even the most routine ground ball. His overall ability to hit has improved, and most don't fear he'll be one of those speedsters who falters at the highest level because he can't hit. Hamilton made the move from shortstop to center field in the Arizona Fall League in 2012 and showed pretty good instincts there from the get-go, with the ability to out-run mistakes as he learns more about getting good reads and jumps. Hamilton made his Major League debut in September and gave the Reds a glimpse of the kind of impact his speed makes.\",\n '\\n \\nFor two years in a row, the Reds went with a high-upside, projectable high-school right-hander with their first-round pick, taking Nick Travieso in 2012 and Stephenson the year before that. Seeing them top the Cincinnati rotation in the future is the plan and, as long as patience is used, could very well happen. Stephenson has everything a team wants in a frontline starter, from size to stuff to mound presence. His fastball is a plus pitch, and his curve shows glimpses of giving him another above-average or plus offering. Stephenson has shown improvement with his changeup as well, giving him three pitches to succeed as he moves up the ladder. As he learns more about pitching, he should have at least average command. The Reds were cautious with Stephenson in his first two seasons, but he climbed all the way to Double-A Pensacola in 2013.',\n \" Russell's conditioning and future position had some concerned about the Florida prepster as he entered his senior year of high school. But Russell shed weight, improved his overall conditioning and had a fantastic season to move into the top half of the first round. Then he went out and had as good, if not the best, of any debut by a 2012 draftee, finishing his summer in the full-season Midwest League. Russell displayed outstanding bat speed and he should have above-average power in the future. He should become an even better all-around hitter as he learns to adjust to offspeed stuff. He's an average runner, maybe a tick above, but he's aggressive on the basepaths and should continue to steal some bases. It was initially assumed that Russell would have to move to third as a pro, and his bat would profile just fine there, but he's convinced many he can stay at shortstop with good hands, a well above-average arm and solid range. With his stunning debut, Russell could move more quickly than many high school hitters.\",\n \" The top first base prospect in the game, Singleton came to the Astros from the Phillies in the July 2011 Hunter Pence deal. Playing his entire first full season with the Astros at age 20, he acquitted himself well in Double-A and played in the Arizona Fall League. He appeared to be nearly ready to help out in Houston, perhaps after some Triple-A time, but that plan was derailed by a 50-game suspension for a second positive test for a drug of abuse. Most believe that won't impact him on the field, assuming it doesn't become a recurring problem. Singleton has some outstanding offensive tools. Big and strong, he has bat speed and leverage to hit for average and power. He will swing and miss, especially on soft stuff, but he'll also draw walks. Singleton doesn't wow defensively, but he should be fine at first base. With the move to the American League, there's room for another bat, and with his suspension behind him, it shouldn't be long before he's ready to contribute.\",\n \"\\n \\nd'Arnaud has been snakebitten the past two years by knee injuries that have prevented him from graduating to the big leagues. He finally made his Major League debut in August and quickly took over as the Mets starting catcher. The Phillies originally drafted d'Arnaud before trading him to the Blue Jays as a part of the Roy Halladay deal. He was then traded to the Mets in December 2012 as a part of the package for R.A. Dickey. When healthy, d'Arnaud has the tools to be a top-flight all-around backstop. He's agile and athletic with a good arm and has worked hard to improve his throwing. He has the ability to hit for both average and power and is a natural leader behind the plate.\",\n \"\\n \\nIf you wanted to build a prototype of what a big, strong, projectable pitching prospect should look like, starting with Sanchez might not be a bad idea. The Blue Jays had aggressively stockpiled young arms via the Draft in recent years. Some of them were used as trading chips, but Sanchez remains, and for good reason. His pure stuff is outstanding, with a plus fastball and an outstanding curve to give him as good a one-two punch as any pitching prospect. His changeup projects to be at least an average offering. He throws downhill and there's room for him to add some strength. Sanchez needs to cut down on his walk rate to succeed as he moves up, but he has all the makings of a frontline starter if that happens as the Blue Jays start to take the kid gloves off.\",\n \" Byron Buxton got most of the buzz as the toolsiest high school outfielder in the 2012 Draft class, but Almora wasn't far behind. The Florida prepster, who starred for USA Baseball on numerous occasions, has excellent bat speed and can drive the ball to all fields. While he's not the biggest guy on the field, he has surprising pop and should grow into decent power down the road. Almora is an excellent defensive center fielder with good range and a strong arm. Beyond his physical skills, Almora's top tools are his instincts and his makeup, both of which are off the charts and allow his already-impressive abilities to play up even more.\",\n \"\\n \\nPower and speed. It's a combination always in high demand in a player, but often difficult to find. But there's no question Springer has plenty of both, and not the raw kind of tools that never show up. His outstanding bat speed allows the University of Connecticut product to drive the ball to all fields, with plenty of power to leave the yard regularly. While he does tend to strike out a good amount, most feel he'll hit enough to tap into that power and hit for a little average. His speed is legit and he should continue to be a threat on the basepaths and a well above-average defensive center fielder, though he has the arm for right field should that be the spot the Astros need him to play. He gets very high marks for his makeup and energy. Springer went 20-20 in his first full season of pro ball and there's no reason to think that won't be a regular occurrence for him in the future.\",\n \" Hultzen's first full season of pro ball was a tale of two years. He was dominant in Double-A, then struggled once he moved up to Triple-A. The biggest surprise was a loss of control (he finished 2012 with a 5.4 BB/9 rate), something that was a plus for Hultzen coming out of the University of Virginia. Most see that as a blip on the radar and still feel his stuff and pitchability should have him ready for the big leagues very soon. Hultzen will run his fastball up to 93 mph and it has sink and tail to it. When he's on, he can locate it to both sides of the plate. His changeup is his next-best pitch, an above-average offering, with an ability to pull the string on it. His slider is improved, with good deception and control of it, giving him the chance to have three above-average-or-better offerings. If his control issues are a thing of the past, he'll help in Seattle sooner rather than later.\",\n \" \\n\\nAppel was considered by many to be one of the top prospects in the 2012 Draft but he fell to the Pirates at No. 8 for a variety of reasons. He eventually chose not to sign and returned to Stanford for his senior season. He was once again considered among the top prospects in 2013 and the Astros didn't pass him up a second time, selecting the Houston native first overall. Appel is a complete package as a pitcher, combining stuff, size and pitchability. He mixes his mid- to upper-90s fastball with a good slider and changeup, giving him a chance for three plus offerings. One of the knocks on him in 2012 was his lack of strikeouts, but he improved on that as a senior and now misses plenty of bats. Appel profiles as a top of the rotation starter and could reach Houston in a hurry.\",\n '\\n \\nThree Cuban outfielders signed big contracts with Major League organizations in 2012. Yoenis Cespedes and Yasiel Puig have already established themselves as Major League stars. Soler, the youngest of the three, had his development slowed this year by a stress fracture in his left tibia. He returned in time to play in the Arizona Fall League to help make up for lost time. Soler combines a very good approach at the plate with good discipline. His plus bat speed gives him the ability to drive the ball to all fields and he has significant raw power. A solid runner, Soler has an above-average arm, giving him both the offensive and defensive profile for a prototypical right fielder.',\n '\\n \\nSanchez has been on radars since the Yankees gave him $3 million to sign out of the Dominican Republic. Hitting .353 in his United States debut didn&#8217;t hurt and he&#8217;s tantalized with his skills since. Sanchez appears to have put some of the attitude issues he had during his full-season debut in 2011 behind him and it should be noted he&#8217;ll still be just 20 years old for all of the 2013 season. Sanchez earned a promotion in 2012 and his bat should help him continue to move up the ladder. He has above-average raw power and his approach at the plate has improved, giving him the chance to be an outstanding all-around hitter. He&#8217;s always had a plus arm behind the plate, but there had been questions about his ability to handle the defensive rigors of the position in the past. He did seem to make some strides with the glove, though he needs to continue to work on his receiving skills, and the Yankees hope that can continue.',\n \" A subpar junior season at South Carolina, which ended in injury, may have been the biggest blessing for the Boston Red Sox. Otherwise, the talented outfielder would not have been around in the supplemental first round of the 2011 Draft. Bradley put that rough final college campaign in his rear view mirror quickly by reaching Double-A in his first full season and finishing second in the system in batting average while topping the organization in on-base percentage. He can really hit and can square up to the ball consistently to go along with his superb on-base skills. He's not a burner, but his plus instincts make him a threat on the bases as well as a plus defender in center field. Bradley's torrid spring landed him a spot on Boston's Opening Day roster.\",\n \"\\n \\nGuerrieri jumped into the first round of the 2011 Draft because of his arm strength and projectability. In the early stages of his pro career &#8211; he didn't make his debut until 2012 &#8211; he's shown a solid feel for pitching to go along with his electric pure stuff. The South Carolina prep product has a plus fastball with a ton of sink that leads to a lot of ground-ball outs. His hard downer curve should be at least above-average and he continues to improve with his changeup, a pitch he didn't need or throw in high school. He has a clean delivery and the prototypical pitcher's body, which bodes well for a continuation of good control and command of his pitches.\",\n '\\n \\nTypically, amateurs who are new to pitching are valuable because they have fresher arms or might have fewer bad habits to break. They&#8217;re not supposed to have an advanced feel for pitching and have the chance to move very quickly through a farm system. But that&#8217;s exactly who Zimmer is. The University of San Francisco product was an infielder then turned to pitching as a sophomore and became one of the top pitching prospects in the 2012 Draft class. He threw extremely well in his summer debut, even though he eventually had bone chips removed from his elbow. Zimmer has the chance to have four above-average or better offerings. He&#8217;s a very good athlete who repeats his delivery well, going right after hitters and throwing a lot of strikes. It shouldn&#8217;t take him too long to be ready for Kansas City.',\n ' The first high school arm taken in the 2012 Draft, Fried got his feet wet professionally last summer, but Padres fans will truly get the chance to see what he&#8217;s about in 2013. The Southern California product has three pitches, all of which should be above average or better in the future. He also has a better feel for pitching than many prepsters, with advanced command to go with it. Fried was typically 90-91 mph in high school, touching 94, but don&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s more there as he matures physically. His curve has the chance to be just as good, especially as he learns to stay on top of it more consistently. Add in an above-average changeup and even an occasional cutter, and it&#8217;s easy to see why many think Fried will be able to move more quickly than most high school pitchers.',\n \"\\n \\nFor much of his amateur career, Meyer intrigued with his plus arm strength, but had trouble always finding the strike zone. He made great strides in that regard during his junior year at Kentucky, pitching himself into the first round and that continued for the most part during his first full season. He took his power repertoire to the Twins organization when the Nationals sent him to Minnesota for Denard Span during the offseason. With his tall, slender frame, Meyer will run into delivery issues, and while that can lead to command problems, he threw strikes more often than not while pitching at two levels. His fastball has a ton of sink and generates groundballs aplenty and he complements it with a big slider that gets swings and misses. His sinking changeup has the chance to be more than usable. All that, if he can maintain his delivery and stay in the strike zone, adds up to the kind of frontline starter the Twins haven't developed in quite some time.\",\n \"\\n\\nGray didn't enter the spring with much fanfare and his teammate Dillon Overton was considered to be Oklahoma's best Draft-eligible pitcher. That quickly changed as Gray's fastball was regularly clocked up to 100 mph. Gray's track record isn't as long as a typical top college pitcher, such as Mark Appel, but his exciting stuff eventually put him in the conversation for the No. 1 overall pick anyway. Gray has excellent size for a right-hander and uses it to generate easy velocity. He throws his fastball in the mid- to upper-90s. Gray's slider is his best offspeed pitch and he also throws a solid changeup. He improved his command this year and pitches well off his fastball. Gray has the stuff to become a top of the rotation starter.\",\n \"\\n \\nWhen the Padres gave Hedges $3 million in the second round of the 2011 Draft in order to keep him from his UCLA commitment, they hoped they were getting a young catcher who really knew how to defend and whose bat would develop eventually. His first full season showed he was just as good as advertised. Hedges has great hands and a plus arm to go along with a quick release and accuracy. He has some pop with an ability to spray line drives to all fields. As long as the bat continues to come along, even as a second fiddle, to the glove, Hedges has everything you'd want in an everyday big league catcher.<p>\",\n \"\\n \\nThere's no question that Ventura's electric arm will get him to the big leagues. What role he ultimately fills remains to be seen. The undersized right-hander has one of the best fastballs in the Minors, sitting in the upper-90s with ease. His hammer of a curve can be unhittable at times. There's deception with his changeup, but it's fairly straight at this point in time, but it could be a Major League average pitch in the future. He can always improve his overall command, but he misses plenty of bats with his fastball-curve combination. That alone could make him a future closer, but there's enough there to think he should get a shot at starting.\",\n \"\\n\\nBryant entered the Draft ranked as the No. 3 overall prospect, but was clearly the top bat in the class. An excellent college performer who also led Team USA last summer, he has easy plus power and can hit the ball out to all fields. While there is some swing and miss to his game, he's far from all-or-nothing at the plate and should develop into a decent all-around hitter. Defensively, Bryant has a plus arm and is a better athlete than some may think. He played right field well when called upon at the University of San Diego and played a capable third the rest of the time, though some think he may end up at first base. Wherever he plays in the field, his bat has the chance to make him an outstanding big leaguer.\",\n \" From a raw tools perspective, Williams is one of the more intriguing prospects in baseball. In 2012, he started to really use his skills more consistently on the field and earned a promotion up a level as a result. Unfortunately, a shoulder injury cut his season short. Williams has some definite ability with the bat, with a solid approach and a handsy swing that allows him to cover the plate well. It's more of a slap/slash approach right now, but some feel there's power to come as he matures. Williams can go get the ball in center field with good range and a solid arm. As he hones his skills on the basepaths, he should become a more consistent basestealing threat. All he needs is time and he'll be ready for center field in the big leagues. If the bat develops, he has the chance to be an elite-level player.\",\n \" Bauer pitched behind Gerrit Cole at UCLA and went two spots after him in the 2011 Draft, but he beat his fellow right-hander to the big leagues, reaching Arizona in his first full season of pro ball. His performance there was inconsistent, at best, but now he'll have to put that behind him with a new organization after the D-backs sent him to Cleveland in the three-team deal with the Reds during the offseason. Stuff-wise, Bauer is still the same guy with many weapons to choose from. He'll throw his plus fastball up to 96 mph and can maintain his velocity. When he stays on top of his curve, that can be a plus offering as well, with 12-to-6 action. He also has a slider, changeup and splitter, all of which can be at least average in the future. Bauer's unorthodox training, including foul line-to-foul line long-tossing, has been well-documented, but regardless of how he's perceived, he should impact the Indians' staff soon.\",\n \" Odorizzi has now twice been involved in major deals involving another team's frontline starter. He came to Kansas City from Milwaukee when the Royals sent Zack Greinke to the Brewers. In his one full season with the Royals, the right-hander pitched well across two levels before receiving his first big league callup in September 2012. Then the Illinois high school product was shipped to the Rays in the James Shields deal, so he'll now try to find a rotation spot in St. Petersburg. Most feel he'll eventually do it, thanks to four pitches that all grade out as at least Major League average. While he doesn't blow people away, his fastball can touch 94 mph. He throws both a curve and slider, with the former grading out a hair better than the latter. His changeup has the chance to be his fourth average offering and he generally commands all of them well. He may not front a rotation, but he could be a very reliable No. 3 type in the very near future.\",\n \" Hanson had put up solid numbers in rookie ball, then surprised some when he made the full-season West Virginia Power out of Spring Training in 2012. All he did there was lead the circuit in total bases while finishing in the top 10 in a host of offensive categories. Hanson makes consistent contact and can drive the ball to all fields and will use an inside-out swing as well. An outstanding bunter, he also has the strength to show occasional home run power. He has very good speed and is still learning how to use it to his benefit on the basepaths. Defensively, he has the range and the hands to stay at shortstop, but his arm has been erratic. Hanson will stay at shortstop for now, and more people believe he can stay there than they did before his full-season debut, but some feel he'll eventually move over to second base.\",\n \" As a multi-sport star who was signed away from being the University of Nebraska's quarterback, it was assumed Starling might take some time to develop as he focused solely on baseball for the first time. Patience will be the key, but the payoff could be huge as Starling has tremendous raw tools to work with. He has a ton of raw power, but he still has a lot of work to do on his overall approach and hitting, so he can tap into that power as he moves forward. He does have good speed and a very strong arm, giving him the skills to play a very good center field, unless he loses some quickness as he physically matures. It may take some time, though the Royals knew that when they drafted him, and how much his bat develops will help determine just how good he is in the future.\",\n \" It&rsquo;s looking like the local boy is going to make good. The Philly area high school product who was drafted by his hometown team has been moving one level at a time, finishing among each league&rsquo;s leaders in ERA and strikeouts for his first two full seasons. Another good sign has been Biddle's improvement, lowering his walk rate while raising his strikeout rate from 2011 to '12. He has the chance to have three above-average-to-plus offerings when all is said and done. While he&rsquo;s not a flame-thrower, typically topping out at around 92 mph, his fastball plays up even more because he gets good angles on it. His big, sweeping curve is a swing-and-miss pitch, and he has a good changeup to go along with the other two. Big and strong, Biddle has a clean delivery that&rsquo;s easy to repeat, which should lead to better and better command as he progresses.\",\n \" The Giants have had some success in developing young pitchers taken out of high school &#8211; see Cain, Matt and Bumgarner, Madison &#8211; and Crick might be the next in line. He's big, strong and athletic, albeit raw. His fastball is easily plus, though he's still learning to command it. While he throws two breaking balls, and both can be effective at times, his slider is the better offering, one that eventually could become a plus pitch. His changeup has improved, though it's behind his other offerings. All the pieces are there for him to be a frontline starter. All he needs is time and experience to tighten his command and improve his offspeed stuff and he'll be ready.\",\n '\\n \\nHaving tools with a grinder-type mentality usually leads to success. That&#8217;s what the Dodgers hope will happen with Pederson, especially after a big second half of the 2012 season, followed by playing for Team Israel in World Baseball Classic qualifying and then the Arizona Fall League. Pederson competes aggressively in all aspects of the game. At the plate, he has a fairly good approach and has shown pretty good gap power so far, though it looks like he might grow into more in the future. A solid runner, he runs well enough to steal a base now and again and to play center field, where his instincts allow his range to play up. He has a good enough arm to move to a corner if need be in the future.',\n \"\\n \\nMarisnick was playing in the Arizona Fall League last year when rumors of the big Blue Jays-Marlins trade began spreading. The toolsy outfielder finished the AFL season in a Blue Jays uniform then was officially dealt two days after the season's completion as part of the package that netted Toronto Jose Reyes, Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson and company. When he's locked in, Marisnick oozes with tools. He has a lot more raw power to grow into, more than he's shown in games so far. His above-average speed plays up even more because of his outstanding baserunning instincts. He's an excellent defender in center field, with more than enough range to stay there, though his solid arm would work from right. Perhaps the only thing holding Marisnick back might be some holes in his swing, and he's shown the ability at times to make adjustments to lessen them, something that will help him become a complete hitter. Marisnick bounced back from a breaking his left hand in Spring Training to make his Major League debut in July.\",\n \" Having to trade someone like Adrian Gonzalez is never a good thing, especially for an organization like the Red Sox, but one of the silver linings of that cloud was the acquisition of Webster from the Dodgers in the deal. A bit of a project as a later-round selection, he has really developed into a right-hander who will be ready to help a big league staff very soon. Webster's best pitch is his fastball, but it's not just because he throws it up into the mid-90s. His heater has plus life with a ton of sink, which has enabled him to get a ton of groundball outs along with swings and misses. His changeup also has sink to it and he has a pretty good feel for it. When he's in sync, his slider is sharp with late break and has glimpses of being an out pitch as well. While Webster rarely gives up the long ball, his command wasn't as sharp in 2012. If he can find better consistency with his outstanding stuff, he can start. If not, a bullpen role could ultimately be his future.\",\n \"\\n \\nThe son of Raul Mondesi, Adalberto had an impressive pro debut in 2012, especially given his age and his level. He was the youngest player in the Appalachian League and kept up with his elders quite well. He showed an ability to hit from both sides of the plate, and while he struck out a bit too much, that's not surprising for a player of his age. He showed a good understanding of what he was doing up there, perhaps a testament to his lineage. He should continue to hit for a decent average as he advances, and most feel the power will come as he matures physically. His speed works on both sides of the ball, and he should be a basestealer who can stay at shortstop long-term. Playing a premium up-the-middle position with that kind of offensive upside, it's no wonder the Royals are excited about his future.\",\n \"\\n \\nKyle Seager's younger brother could end up being better than the Mariners' third baseman, and at the same position. He had a fantastic pro debut in 2012 in the Pioneer League and should be advanced enough to hit full-season ball without a hitch. With plus bat speed, the younger Seager should be able to hit for average and power, making consistent hard contact and driving the ball to all fields. A shortstop in high school, that's where he played in 2012 during his pro debut. But with his size, third base should be a better fit. He has good defensive instincts and a strong arm, which would work just fine from the hot corner. With his natural hitting ability, he could move fairly quickly and be ready to play third in Los Angeles in a few years.\",\n ' The Oklahoma State product parlayed a fantastic junior season into a top 10 selection in the 2012 Draft. As an advanced college left-hander, many scouts expected Heaney to be able to move quickly through the Minor Leagues and he did not disappoint, reaching Double-A Jacksonville in his first full season. His fastball reaches 93 mph and he maintains his velocity deep into starts. Heaney has a terrific breaking ball which generates swings and misses. His changeup has deception and sink, and it could be a third above-average-or-better pitch. Heaney has a firm grasp of the strike zone and mixes his pitches well.',\n \"\\n \\nThe University of Hawaii product went straight to Double-A for his first full season and more than held his own. Though he tired a bit by the end of the year, he learned a lot about what it takes to deal with the grind of the long season and rebounded with a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League. Wong is an aggressive hitter who doesn't draw many walks, but he also doesn't strike out much. He makes consistent hard contact and has more extra-base power than most expect when they see his small and compact frame. Wong will use the whole field and has good instincts on the basepaths. He's also a solid defender at second base, and those plus instincts help him in the field as well. He's just about ready to help out in St. Louis.\",\n \"\\n\\nA strong spring helped Frazier establish himself as one of the top high school players in June's Draft. The Indians were delighted to be able to select him with the fifth overall choice, making him the first prep position player taken. Frazier has the tools to develop into a true five-tool player, but it is his right-handed power that stands out the most. He has a short, quick swing and an advanced approach at the plate. Frazier plays center field now and has a chance to stay at the position, but his bat will still profile in an outfield corner if he does have to move. Possibly the only real knock on Frazier is his size, as he is listed at 6-foot-1, 190 pounds. But his advanced hitting ability and overall tools help him overcome any potential concerns about his lack of physicality.\",\n ' The Southern California high school standout had a very successful first full season, spending the year in the South Atlantic League and finishing fourth in strikeouts despite being on an innings count. Tall and lanky, the ball comes out of Owens&rsquo; hand free and easy, allowing his lively fastball to play up. Despite his walk rate, he actually can locate his fastball in and out of the strike zone fairly well. Owens has two breaking balls, with both the curve and the slider looking like average offerings at least. He has a very good changeup which he uses as an out pitch effectively. His ceiling might be that of a No. 3 starter, but that&rsquo;s nothing to sneeze at, and the gloves could come off a bit in 2013.',\n '\\n \\nWhile the Blue Jays used some of their young pitching depth in trades during the offseason, that didn&#8217;t leave that cupboard bare. As long as everyone can be patient, Osuna may help fill the void quite nicely. The nephew of former big league reliever Antonio Osuna, he will be just 18 years old for all of the 2013 season. Osuna has a plus fastball that can touch the mid-90s and he commands it pretty well. His slider will be solid in the future, though it&#8217;s a bit inconsistent right now and he has a better feel for a changeup than most teenagers. His overall command and pitchability is advanced for his age, which should enable him to continue to be young for his level, even if he&#8217;s developed cautiously.',\n '\\n \\nThis University of Connecticut product had a solid first full season of pro ball in 2012, including a visit to the Futures Game, though he clearly ran out of gas and struggled a bit in the second half of the season. Barnes has everything a team is looking for in a future frontline starter: arm strength, good overall stuff and even a feel for pitching. He isn&#8217;t afraid to go right after hitters or go inside, especially with his plus fastball that touches 96 mph. His tight downer curve has the chance to be an out pitch as well and while his changeup is clearly his third pitch, it&#8217;s improving and should be an average offering in the future. With good overall command, it shouldn&#8217;t take him too long to be ready for Boston.',\n '\\n \\nWhen the Pittsburgh Pirates decided to roll the dice in the 2012 Draft by taking Mark Appel, the Colorado Rockies may have been the biggest beneficiaries. They were able to select the toolsy Dahl, who many thought was going to Pittsburgh. All the Alabama high school product did was win Pioneer League MVP honors in his pro debut, leading the rookie-level circuit in a host of offensive categories, including batting average, total bases and OPS. Dahl can flat-out hit, with good bat speed and a better idea of what he&#8217;s doing at the plate than most hitters his age. There&#8217;s definitely extra-base pop in his bat now and he could develop decent home run power down the road. An above-average runner, he&#8217;ll be more of a basestealing threat as he learns those skills. He has a plus arm in the outfield and has the chance to be a top-notch defender in the future.',\n \" Young and still a bit raw, the Rangers saw enough during Alfaro's U.S. debut, especially with the bat, to send him to full-season ball in 2012. Injuries slowed him a bit, especially from developing behind the plate, but the upside is still considerable for this Colombian backstop. He's physically impressive with a ton of strength and plus bat speed. He has raw power to all fields and he'll tap into that more consistently as he refines his approach and cuts down on this swing. He should be a very good all-around hitter once he gets to the highest level. He still has a ways to go defensively, especially since he caught so infrequently in 2012. He does have a plus arm that he needs to learn how to use more efficiently and while he's athletic enough to stay behind the plate, he needs to refine his receiving skills as well. The Rangers might have to be patient, but Alfaro should be worth the wait.<p>\",\n '\\n \\nThe Dodgers made a huge splash by signing Lee away from quarterbacking at LSU and the right-hander has been moving quickly since. Lee reached Double-A in 2012 and will pitch the 2013 season at age 21. He has four pitches that have the chance to be Major League average or better and he can throw all of them for strikes. He&#8217;ll sit in the 92-93 mph range with good movement to his fastball. He throws two breaking balls, a hard slider and a softer curve, and he has a very good feel for a sinking changeup. He can work both sides of the plate and doesn&#8217;t hurt himself with walks. Without a true plus out pitch, there might be some limit to his ceiling, but his size, age and pitchability all point to a career in the middle of a rotation.',\n \"\\nOlt entered the 2013 season seemingly ready for a big league job, but there was no room on the Rangers' Opening Day roster. Then Olt had problems with blurry vision that caused him to get off to a bad start and miss the entire month of May. He bounced back in June, regaining his power stroke, before being dealt to the Cubs in the Matt Garza trade in July. His hands, range and arm, the last of which being his best defensive tool, all play very well at third, though he's seen time at first and in the outfield as well. Olt may not hit for a really high average, and fans should be prepared for a good amount of strikeouts, but he'll also draw a ton of walks and is a better all-around hitter than many anticipated. The power is legit, too, and it's not a projection. Assuming healthy, he should be ready to hit in Wrigley Field soon.\",\n ' There might be other young pitchers with more pure stuff, even those who were taken along with Nicolino out of high school by the Toronto Blue Jays. But this lefty -- sent to the Marlins in the blockbuster deal that gave Toronto Jose Reyes, Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, Emilio Bonifacio and John Buck -- has more polish than many pitchers of his age. That&rsquo;s not to say he doesn&rsquo;t have good stuff. Nicolino&rsquo;s fastball will sit in the 89-91 mph range, and he throws it with good deception and movement. His curve has good three-quarters break to it when he throws it correctly, and his changeup can be a plus pitch. Nicolino can throw them all for strikes even if there&rsquo;s a little cross-fire to his delivery. His feel for pitching could allow him to start moving faster.',\n \"\\n \\nThe son of the big league pitcher of the same name, McCullers was one of the top high school arms in the 2012 Draft class, especially in terms of arm strength. He slid because of signability, and the Astros were able to be creative to bring another first round talent into the system. The right-hander has a plus plus fastball that reaches the upper-90s with ease and has excellent movement, especially in on right-handed hitters. His slider is an above-average pitch as well, particularly when he stays on top of it. McCullers' changeup is behind the first two, but he has a feel for it, and he's sure to work on it as a professional. He's aggressive on the mound and goes right after hitters, with a closer mentality. In the past, McCullers struggled with command, and many thought his future might be as a short reliever, but he showed improvement in his senior year, allowing some to feel more confident about his future as a starter.\",\n \" \\n\\nStewart excited scouts before the Draft with his premium stuff and athleticism and he established himself as the best high school pitcher available. Stewart was a two-sport star in high school and signed a letter of intent to play quarterback and pitch at Texas A&M. That, combined with his Type 1 diabetes, made him somewhat of a challenge to evaluate. The Twins, however, liked his complete package and made him the fourth overall pick of the Draft. Stewart throws his fastball in the low- to mid-90s, regularly touching 96 mph. He also throws a changeup and slider, which might be his best pitch. He is still learning how to pitch, but he could quickly improve his feel for the craft now that he is solely focused on pitching. Stewart joins Minnesota's newfound wealth of premium pitching prospects and has as much potential as any of the group.\",\n '\\n \\nRepeating a level can be a good thing. After struggling in the South Atlantic League in his first full season, Foltynewicz went back there and dominated, being named the league&#8217;s Most Outstanding Pitcher. His lean and lanky frame fit the prototype for projectable right-handers. A power pitcher, he has a three-pitch mix that should work well for him, starting with a plus fastball that touches 98 mph, coming from a loose and easy arm action. His downer curve will show decent bite and he&#8217;s able to maintain his arm speed on his sinking changeup. Once he tightens up the secondary pitches and improves his command, he has everything a team would want from a workhorse in a big league rotation.',\n \" Rosario was having another outstanding year offensively during his full-season debut when a line drive to his face shelved him for six weeks. He did perform well after returning, continuing to be one of the better prospects in the Twins' system. He has a knack for making consistent hard contact with good bat speed coming from a low-hands setup. He does have a little power, but will likely be more of a contact, on-base guy as he progresses. Rosario does have decent speed, better under way, but likely isn't going to be a major basestealer. Starting out as an outfielder, he made the move to second base and made some progress there, though there's obviously still work to be done. A move back to the outfield, where he played some over the winter, is always an option, though his bat -- his ticket to the big leagues -- would profile better at second base.\",\n \"\\nOne of two former Yucaipa High (Calif.) supplemental first-rounders to make his big league debut in 2013 -- Mariners right-hander Taijuan Walker is the other -- Davidson joined the White Sox in a December trade for Addison Reed. \\n<p> \\nDavidson's calling card in his above-average right-handed power, which he showed off by winning the home run derby at the Triple-A All-Star Game in July. That came on the heels of an MVP performance at the Futures Game. He can drive the ball out of the park to all fields and also shows the willingness to take a walk when pitchers won't challenge him. \\n<p> \\nDavidson has a long swing and a propensity for striking out, so he doesn't project to hit for a high average. He has a solid arm and has worked hard on his play at third base, though he'll probably be an average defender at best. While he has well below-average speed, he has decent instincts on the basepaths.\",\n \"\\n \\nKelly hasn't made the most direct line to the big leagues, and just as it looked like he was about ready to contribute full time at the big league level, his elbow set him back again, as he needed Tommy John surgery this spring and will miss the entire 2013 season. A big-time quarterback recruit, the Boston Red Sox signed him away from playing two sports at Tennessee then let him play shortstop and pitch in his first full season. He switched to the mound full time in 2010 and was then dealt in December following that season to the Padres in the Adrian Gonzalez deal. He probably would have spent more time in the big leagues in 2012 if he hadn't missed most of the season with an elbow strain. Kelly's best weapon is his above-average sinking fastball that generates a ton of groundball outs. His curve has a chance to be at least above-average as well and his changeup gives him a third effective offering. He generally commands the ball well and keeps the ball down, not hurting himself with walks or homers.\",\n \"\\n \\nThere's no question Goodwin posseses all five tools on the baseball field. All he needs to do is learn how to use them consistently. The center fielder is a premium athlete who profiles as a top-of-the-order catalyst. Using a compact swing, he can drive the ball to all fields. He works counts and understands that he needs to get on base. Getting comps to Denard Span, he has more power potential than the center fielder the Nationals acquired this offsesason. His speed will help him on the basepaths and in the outfield, though he's still learning how to use it more to his advantage. His arm and actions in the outfield work just fine. Span's arrival allows Washington the luxury of letting Goodwin develop at his own pace.\",\n '\\n \\nHigh school hitters are supposed to go to rookie ball to start their professional careers the summer after they sign and get their feet wet. Hawkins did that and then some, starting in the Pioneer League, but then getting bumped up twice and finishing the year in the Carolina League playoffs, where he contributed two homers. If he keeps that up, he&#8217;ll be known for much more than his Draft night back flip. Hawkins can turn on any fastball and has at least above-average raw power to all fields. With the power comes a lot of swing and miss and he will have to refine his approach at the plate to have continued success and be a better all-around hitter. His above-average speed works well on the basepaths and in center field for now, though he may end up getting pushed to a corner as he matures. The arm that could throw 90-mph fastballs from the mound would look just fine in right field, as would his profile as a power-hitting run producer in the future.',\n '\\n \\nAustin burst on the scene in 2011 when he hit .354 in two short-season stops. Despite missing time with a concussion that forced him out of the Futures Game in 2012, he showed that his previous season was no mirage. He reached Double-A, even homering in the playoffs, while topping the organization in batting average and slugging percentage while finishing second in on-base percentage and third in RBIs. A former infielder, Austin made a smooth transition to right field and should profile well there, though perhaps without the plus power some like to see from the position. Still, he has a very good approach at the plate and a quick swing that should allow him to continue to hit for average. He&#8217;s a good baserunner with average speed, and has the arm and range to be a good defensive outfielder. It&#8217;s not often 13th-round picks turn into big league regulars, but this one has a chance to do just that.',\n \"\\n\\nDepending on who was asked, Meadows was the first or second best high school bat in the 2013 Draft class along with fellow Georgia prepster Clint Frazier. Meadows looks the part: tall, athletic and projectable with five-tool potential. A left-handed hitter, Meadows has a smooth swing and a fairly advanced approach at the plate, leading many to believe he'll be at least an above-average hitter in the future. He has room to add strength to his frame, though there was debate over just how much power he'll end up having. Meadows runs very well and has a solid arm in the outfield. One scout not with the Pirates said he wouldn't be surprised if Meadows ended up being the best player from this Draft class when all was said and done.\",\n \"\\n \\nWhen Giolito was healthy, there were few who would have argued that he didn't have the best pure stuff of any pitcher in the 2012 Draft class. But the big right-hander wasn't healthy, missing his senior season with a sprained UCL in his right elbow. The Nationals were willing to roll the dice and went over pick value to sign him away from UCLA. Giolito had Tommy John surgery in August 2012 and missed most of the 2013 season as a result. Early reports from Giolito's return were good, and it appears he will once again be a dominant force on the mound. When healthy, he has a plus fastball, a power curve that also might be plus and a solid changeup. His command is much better than it is for most power-armed teenagers, and he gets high marks for his mound presence and makeup. Time is still very much on Giolito's side, as he is still just 19 years old.\",\n '\\n \\nHe&#8217;s not going to cause any kind of logjam with Elvis Andrus and Jurickson Profar just yet, but the Rangers do have another quality shortstop prospect making his way through their system. Sardinas signed at the same time as Profar, but has been a bit slower to develop. Patience might be a virtue as Sardinas had a solid first year of full-season ball and then held his own in the Arizona Fall League against much older competition in 2012. He can handle the bat from both sides of the  plate, making consistent contact in slashing line drives to all fields. He has terrific defensive skills, with speed that works on the basepaths and gives him excellent range to go along with an outstanding arm. He has played some second base if there&#8217;s ever an issue there, but he&#8217;ll continue to develop as a shortstop for now.',\n \"\\n\\nMoran re-established the University of North Carolina on the first-round map after a one-year absence in 2012 after the Tar Heels had first rounds in 2009-2011. Moran is a big, strong left-handed hitting third baseman. He's an advanced hitter who should hit for average and shouldn't take too much time for his bat to be big-league ready. How much power he grows into remains to be seen, but he's been a solid run producer throughout his college career. He should be able to stay at the hot corner defensively, even if he's not a Gold Glove caliber third baseman. He's hoping to follow in his uncle B.J. Surhoff's footsteps to the big leagues.\",\n \"\\n \\nFranco proved himself in his full-season debut in 2012, rallying in the second half of the year to finish fourth in home runs and third in RBIs in the organization. But his real breakout would come in 2013. Franco played for the World Team in the Futures Game and earned a midseason promotion to Double-A Reading. Like with many young hitters who have raw power, how much of it shows up in games really depends on what kind of hitter he becomes. If he can become an average hitter, then there's a good chance he'll have plus pop down the line. With a strong arm and the chance to be an average defender, he has the tools to profile very well at the hot corner in the future.\",\n \"\\n \\nSometimes repeating a level isn't such a bad thing. That's what DeShields did in 2012 after a subpar first taste of the South Atlantic League in 2011 and if it hadn't been for Billy Hamilton's 155-steal season, DeShields' 101 steals in 2012 would have generated a ton of buzz around baseball. Just like his father, he profiles a compact and strong leadoff hitter, though junior might end up with more power than dad had. The younger DeShields did just about everything more consistently in his second full season, from using all fields to drawing walks, from success on the basepaths to improving his glovework. Not only does he have plus plus speed, he understands how to use it as an effective basestealer. His defense at second has improved, but even if that doesn't work out, he has the tools to make a move to center field eventually if needed.\",\n ' Lee&rsquo;s name has been on prospect radars for quite some time, going to two Futures Games and being included in the big trade that sent Matt Garza from the Rays to the Cubs. The South Korean is a plus defender across the board, capable of making highlight-reel plays, one who could handle playing defensively in the big leagues immediately. The bigger question is just how much he&rsquo;ll hit. He&rsquo;s been a little less productive in Double-A, though he does have a good line-drive type swing and will slash the ball the other way. Lee has plus speed which not only helps him defensively, but should make him a basestealing threat. If the bat can improve, Lee could hit at or near the top of the lineup and be an impact player on both sides. Even if it doesn&rsquo;t, seeing Lee playing Gold Glove caliber shortstop while hitting at the bottom of a lineup every day isn&rsquo;t difficult.',\n \"\\n \\nSince signing out of Mexico, Heredia has been challenged with assignments that put him way ahead of the curve. In 2012, he was the youngest pitcher in the New York-Penn League and more than held his own. Pitching downhill from his 6-foot-6 frame, Heredia's fastball touches 95 mph and should be a consistently plus pitch. His secondary stuff has the chance to be plus as well, from his hard curve to his changeup. Heredia has a better feel for pitching than most teenagers and he gets high marks for his makekup and mound presence. The combination of size, stuff, pitchability and work ethic all point to the potential as a front-line starter.\",\n '\\n \\nThe top arm coming out of Puerto Rico, Berrios is a strong, undersized right-hander with the chance to have three above-average to plus pitches. He&#8217;ll throw his fastball now in the 93-96 range, can elevate it when he needs to and can work down in the zone as well, showing good movement when he does. His power breaking ball is a hammer and might be an out pitch as he progresses. The changeup might be slightly behind right now, but he has a good feel for it and it might be just as good, if not better, than the curve. He&#8217;s aggressive and tends to be around the strike zone with better command than most high schoolers. He&#8217;s not a projectable high school arm, but rather one who is physically mature. But that&#8217;s just fine, because who he is now should be plenty to get him moving toward Minnesota.',\n ' Mark Trumbo and Mike Trout are in the big leagues making large contributions. Cowart could be the next homegrown bat to make a huge impact in Los Angeles. The third baseman has a ton of bat speed and has the ability to drive the ball from both sides of the plate, and he should continue to tap into his raw power. His improvements with his approach and plate discipline are helping him become a better all-around hitter. Cowart is an above-average runner and his athleticism, not to mention his plus throwing arm, will help him stay at third long-term. He has the chance to be a very good everyday big leaguer whose tools work very well on both sides of the ball.',\n \"\\n\\nLiriano should develop into a prototypical right fielder with a very strong arm, the ability to drive in runs and some baserunning skills to boot, but that development was put on hold when reconstructive elbow surgery forced him out for the entire 2013 season. The toolsy outfielder wasn't ready for the California League in 2011 and had to go back down to the Midwest League. When he moved back up a level in 2012, he took the Cal League by storm, earning a promotion to Double-A. There is little Liriano can't do on the field. He has tremendous bat speed, which should help him develop more power, and improved plate discipline has been a key to him becoming a better all-around hitter. It's not just at the plate where Liriano needs to tone things down at times. He's very aggressive on the basepaths and in the outfield, sometimes to a fault.\",\n \"\\nIt hasn't been the easiest road for Ranaudo, the one-time LSU ace. It started with an elbow issue during his junior year of college, though he turned it around and had a huge Cape Cod League showing to get an over-slot deal as a sandwich round pick. He had a full, healthy season in 2011, reaching the Class A Advanced Carolina League. That progress halted when he was limited to just seven starts in 2012 as he battled a groin injury for much of the year, followed by shoulder fatigue that officially ended his season in July. Now healthy, the Red Sox are hopeful he's moving back in the right direction. When he's healthy, he still has the stuff to be dominant and his stuff appeared to be creeping back to where it should be when he was pitching in the Puerto Rico Winter League. While command of his above-average fastball was spotty, the consistency of his outstanding curve was back to his pre-injury college days. Add in a good feel for a changeup and there's still a lot to like.\",\n \"\\n \\nIt often takes time for those high-ceilinged, hard-throwing high schoolers to develop into pitchers. For some, it takes longer than others and while Cole fits more into the latter category, there's still a lot to like about the projectable right-hander. Clearly, the Nationals agree as they re-acquired the player they initially drafted during this past offseason after sending him to the A's in the December 2011 deal that brought Gio Gonzalez to Washington. He still has the big arm that made him a big-time prospect in the 2010 Draft, delivering fastballs that touch 96 mph with good movement. His curve can be a bit slurvy, but has the chance to be at least an average power breaking ball. He has good feel for a fading changeup. There is still plenty of time for him to develop his secondary stuff and overall command and become the frontline starter many think he has the potential to become.\",\n \"\\n\\nRays fans should get ready for another Colome to pitch in Tampa very soon. Alex is the nephew of former big leaguer Jesus Colome, who spent several years pitching for the Rays. He's knocking on the door, having reached Triple-A in 2012, though he missed considerable time with injuries. When he was on the mound, he continued to show tremendous stuff while developing a better feel for pitching. The arm strength has always been there and Colome shows a plus fastball, up to 96-97 mph. There's some sink to it as well and he gets a good amount of ground-ball outs as a result. He throws both a slider and a curve. The curve is better, especially when he stays on top it, throwing it with tight spin. The slider has a cutter action to it and both it and his changeup have the chance to be average pitches. If his command can continue to improve, he has the chance to contribute as a starter. If not, he'll definitely contribute out of the bullpen.\",\n \"\\n \\nSo that's what all the fuss was about. The Red Sox had signed Cecchini to an above-slot deal in 2010 even though he had missed his senior season of high school with a torn ACL. He was having a solid pro debut in 2011, but the injury bug struck again, this time a broken wrist from an errant pitch. He stayed healthy in 2012 and may have been the most consistent hitter in the Red Sox system, showing an ability to hit for average and get on base. He's big and strong and has the chance to develop power later, but for now he's content to use the whole field. Keep in mind that Greenville's park is modeled after Fenway Park, which can be rough at times for left-handed hitters. The stat that stands out from his 2012 season is his organization-leading 51 steals. His younger brother, Gavin, a 2012 first-round pick of the Mets, is the Cecchini who's supposed to have the better run tool. Garin grades out with average speed, but his plus plus instincts and aggressiveness allow him to be a threat. He should be a solid defender at third in the future as well.\",\n \"\\n \\nRepeating a level can be a good thing for a young player and considering that Owings played most of 2012 at age 20, heading back to the California League wasn't going to be detrimental to his development. He played his way up a level, then performed well as Mobile won the Southern League championship. The tools are there for Owings to be an everyday middle infielder in the big leagues. He has the ability to hit for average, but he needs to work on his plate discipline to get there - there's too much swing and miss to his game. His power started to show up in games in 2012 and that could become a regularity. He has solid average speed and should be able to steal some bases in the future and he's capable of being a solid, though unspectacular shortstop defensively. With Didi Gregorius now in the organization, Owings might have to move over to second base to get an opportunity.\",\n \"\\n\\nIt's amazing what growth and maturity can do for a young player. Rodriguez looked like a finesse lefty when he started out his pro career. The Venezuelan's stuff was much better during his 2012 full-season debut, with a tailing fastball that should be above-average. His breaking ball is still a bit inconsistent, but it shows occasional sharp bite and his changeup has improved some as well. He's lean and lanky with some deception to his delivery. He generally throws strikes and if he can keep developing on this path, he has a future as a big league starter.\",\n \"\\n\\nThe top two-way player in the Draft class of 2013, it became clear nearly every team wanted Ball on the mound after a tremendous performance during his senior season in the Indians high school ranks. Tall, lanky and with plenty of room to fill out, Ball should add some strength as he matures, which should allow him to add even more velocity to an already-solid fastball. His loose, quick arm was delivering heaters that touched 94 mph this past spring to go along with a curve that was plus at times. His changeup gives him a third at-least average pitch in the future. His athleticism - he was an outstanding outfield prospect - should help him learn to repeat his delivery, especially now that he's focusing his efforts solely on the mound.\",\n \"\\n \\nNelson began the 2012 season in a prospect-laden Brevard County rotation along with 2011 first-rounders Taylor Jungmann and Jed Bradley, but it was Nelson alone who pitched himself up to Double-A Huntsville. The big, strong right-hander features a heavy fastball that elicits ground balls and sits in the low 90s. His slider has the chance to be above average and he was much better at commanding it than he had been in the past. His changeup is still below average, though he threw it more effectively in 2012. His overall command isn't great, but his deception and sink give him the chance to start. If the command doesn't come, his stuff could play up in a bullpen role if needed.\",\n '\\n \\nA strong finish to his junior season at Radford helped Butler move into the sandwich round. He has a live arm that can deliver fastballs up to 97 mph, and he has a slider that should be a very good secondary pitch in the future. Butler has a changeup, but it&#8217;s behind the fastball-breaking ball combination. He&#8217;s not the biggest guy in the world and has had some command issues in the past, though not during his summer debut in the Pioneer League. With his power stuff and size, some see a future in the bullpen, but the Rockies sent him out as a starter and may give him the chance to stick in a rotation for the time being.',\n '\\n\\nThe Dodgers signed Urias out of Mexico in August 2012 at age 16. He had been with Mexico City in the Mexican League before the Dodgers acquired him. Urias has a good feel for pitching for his age. His fastball sits in the low-90s and he pairs it with an advanced changeup. Listed at 5-foot-11, 160 pounds, Urias still has a lot of projection left in him. It was his pitchability that made the Dodgers confident enough to send the teenager to the full-season Midwest League for his United States debut.',\n \"\\n \\nJorge's brother, Emilio, is in the big leagues, and as long as people are patient, they'll likely see the younger Bonifacio there, too, in the future. Jorge packs a much bigger punch than his brother, with a fast bat and the ability to drive the ball to all fields. He's shown an ability to make adjustments, a good sign for his development as a hitter. And if he hits, the power will come, as he has at least above-average raw pop. His strong arm combines very nicely with his offensive profile to project him as a prototypical right fielder in the future.\",\n \"\\n \\nOakland's first-round pick in 2010, Choice was dealt -- along with Chris Bostick -- to the Rangers for Craig Gentry and Josh Lindblom in December 2013. Throughout his career, Choice has been known for two things: his raw power and his propensity to swing and miss. He's lived up to his billing, hitting 61 homers and striking out 382 times in 371 professional games. Despite the big numbers in those two categories, he's not an all-or-nothing hitter. He does draw walks and he's shown an ability to make adjustments and turn things around. He's also fairly athletic and has played all three outfield positions. Even if he does settle in a corner position -- likely left field because of his below-average arm strength -- his bat should get him to the big leagues. Once he's there, Choice has the chance to be a better all-around hitter than perhaps people give him credit for.\",\n '\\n\\nIt was difficult enough to evaluate Stroman coming out of Duke as an undersized right-hander who could fire mid-90s fastballs with surprising ease to go along with a power breaking ball. He even showed the ability to mix in a changeup and throw strikes as a starter in his final college season. That evaluation became tougher when Stroman was suspended for 50 games for taking a performance-enhancing drug, though Stroman said he unknowingly took the substance as part of an over-the-counter supplement. The Blue Jays sent Stroman out as a reliever and he had reached Double-A by August during his pro debut. If he can return to the game without any further issues, he still has the chance to be a very quick to the big leagues power arm coming out of the bullpen.',\n \" The Braves stayed in their own backyard for this first-round pick. The former Georgia prep star features two above-average pitches, with a fastball that runs up to 94 mph with above-average life and a curve with a three-quarter, tight rotation to it. His changeup, like with many young pitchers, is behind his other offerings, and he needs to improve his overall command. A two-way player in high school, he's a good athlete, which should help him in repeating his delivery in the future. He has outstanding mound presence and aggressiveness on the mound. Sims was one of the younger players in his Draft class, and though he has passed every test so far, the Braves have been careful to bring him along slowly.\",\n \"\\n\\nAs a teenager in the full-season South Atlantic League, Blackburn finished third in the organization in ERA, second in strikeouts and fifth in batting average against while topping all Giants Minor League arms in WHIP. He's polished, especially for a high school draftee. He locates his fastball, which touches 93-94 mph, very well and it has good tail and sink. He's not afraid to pitch inside with it. He needs to find more consistency with his curve, but it has hard, sharp downer motion when he throws it right. He has very good feel for a fading changeup and he can throw all of his pitches for strikes. All the ingredients are there for success as a big league starter and his combination of stuff and pitchability could allow him to start moving faster.\",\n '\\n \\nThe Indians gave Paulino, the son of former big league pitcher Jesus Sanchez, seven figures when the signing period began in July 2011. If his United States debut in 2012 is any indication, it will be money well spent. Paulino was among the rookie-level Arizona League leaders in a host of offensive categories. He has the ability to hit for average and power, with the chance to be above-average with both tools. He&#8217;s a solid runner, maybe a tick above average and that helps him on both sides of the ball. There&#8217;s debate over whether he can stay at shortstop long-term, but that point will eventually be moot thanks to the presence of Francisco Lindor. That&#8217;s fine since it looks like Paulino&#8217;s bat would fit just fine at second or third.',\n '\\n \\nThe Venezuelan infielder should not be overlooked because of size, or lack thereof.  Odor can really hit, using a solid approach at the plate to square up and make consistent, hard contact. He has decent speed, better underway, and has shown an ability to steal a base here and there. He&#8217;s a steady defender with good range and an accurate arm. His instincts help him maximize his tools. He&#8217;ll be just 19 for all of the 2013 season, so he&#8217;s already way ahead of the curve. Seeing him play second every day in the big leagues is a very realistic outcome.',\n \"\\nThe Pirates have been very cautious with Glasnow, keeping him from making his professional debut until a year after he was drafted. The wait may have been worth it, as the big right-hander looked very good in the Gulf Coast League. He has the makings of two plus pitches, with a fastball touching the mid-90s and a curve that can be an out pitch at times. Glasnow's changeup is well below average right now, but there's hope he can develop it with time and experience. With his size, he'll always have to work hard on his delivery to keep his command solid. He's the classic high-risk, high-reward draftee. Glanow has a long way to go, but so far, the signs of progress have been encouraging.\",\n \"\\n \\nSince signing out of the Dominican Republic as a 20-year-old, a bit later than most international prospects, Montero has been on a fast track. Without skipping a level, he raced from the Dominican Summer League to Triple-A Las Vegas in three seasons, playing for eight different teams along the way. He's not the biggest guy in the world, but there aren't concerns about durability. Montero has a real feel for pitching, often pitching backwards with his slider and quality fading changeup. That doesn't mean he doesn't have a fastball. He can touch 95 mph with a ton of life. He can throw all of his pitches for strikes, which bodes well for his future as a member of a big league rotation soon.\",\n 'De Paula first appeared as a prospect in 2008 as Rafael DePaula Figueroa. He was suspended for a year after an MLB investigation into his identity. After producing his real documents and birthdate, De Paula struggled with visa issues for more than a year. He finally made his professional debut in the Dominican Summer League in 2012. His premium fastball has made the wait worth it. De Paula has touched 99 mph and sits in the mid-90s. He also throws a hard curveball and changeup. De Paula made his U.S. debut this year, and appears poised to take a big step forward.',\n '\\n \\nThere is no one in the Phillies&#8217; system with more tools than Quinn. The young shortstop has plus speed, an 8 on the 2-8 scouting scale, and it works for him on both sides of the ball. He led the organization in stolen bases in 2012 and that was in a short-season league. But he&#8217;s far more than just a runner. Quinn could develop into a plus hitter in time, one who hits .300 annually at the big league level. He has a good approach at the plate and understands his job will be to get on base. The switch-hitter has some pop as well and eventually could have average power. He made a lot of progress at shortstop, a new position for him after playing the outfield in high school and he has the arm and range to be above-average defensively there. The sky might be the limit for Quinn; now it&#8217;s all about reaching that ceiling as he moves toward Philadelphia.']"
