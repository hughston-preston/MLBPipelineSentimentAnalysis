# PythonMLBPipelineScrapeProject
This was a collaborative IST 256 Application Programming for Information Systems Final Project completed with classmate Steven DiMaria


This was the final project of IST 256 which is a Python course at Syracuse University, which was a course that I completed in the Fall of 2019. Our project objective 
was to run sentiment analysis on MLB Pipeline scouting reports. The code is currently a mess that I have not worked with in quite some time. The project was succesful, 
but was something with so much depth that I intend to reopene and rework it in the future. I intend to sort and organize the Python code over the summer of 2021. As of 
right now the likely most complete and successful code file is likely the Demo Day code we submitted for the class listed and entitled Finished Demo Day Project.ipynb
